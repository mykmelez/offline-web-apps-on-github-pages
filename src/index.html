      <strong>Abstract: </strong>
      GitHub Pages is a simple web host for static assets. And Offline Web Apps
      are designed to work well on devices without persistent network connections
      (and thus no hard dependencies on dynamic server-side logic).

      Which means GitHub Pages would be a great place to host Offline Web Apps,
      if there was a way for them to ensure they'll be cached despite not having
      control over the web server configuration. Service Workers provides
      that missing piece.

      Come see how Offline Web Apps hosted on GitHub Pages can use Service Workers
      to cache themselves consistently and persistently, including automatic,
      silent, and incremental updates, with graceful degradation on browsers
      that don't support them.

      You'll learn what Service Workers are, find out how to integrate them into
      Grunt and Gulp toolchains, and see demos of Offline Web Apps on GitHub Pages
      surviving page reloads and browser restarts on disconnected devices.

        Offline Web Apps are apps that work when your network connection doesn't.
        Your browser loads them, and you can use them.
        Games, utilities, anything that isn't absolutely dependent on the network.
        Not just for airplane mode, but also on lie-fi (i.e. wi-fi that doesn't work very well).

        Browsers have had caches forever, but going offline usually means losing your ability to access the web.
        Even if a web app's assets are in the browser's cache, it needs the network connection to load them.
        Without a network connection, the web is usually broken.

        For the last few years, the only answer has been Application Cache.

        It's a declarative Web API for specifying the assets of an app in a manifest file.
        Browsers cache the declared assets and then use them when loading the app while offline.
        But AppCache has a variety of issues. It doesn't support popular use cases,
        it's full of footguns, and it just generally doesn't do what web developers want or expect.

        So Web Platform Developers started over.

        Service Workers are the anti-AppCache.
        Whereas AppCache was declarative, Service Workers are declarative.
        Whereas AppCache tried to solve a very specific problem,
        Service Workers is a generic solution for a variety of problems.
        Among them, however, and front-of-mind to the Web Platform Developers
        who worked on the spec, was the Offline Web App use case.

      Service Workers are a powerful abstraction.
      A Service Worker is something akin to a server process running on a client (i.e. a user's machine).
      It can intercept requests and serve them from its own local cache.
      It also has a lifecycle, with well-specified procedures for updates.

        At Mozilla we recently started work on an experimental Node module called Oghliner.
        Oghliner is designed to streamline the process of deploying Offline Web Apps on GitHub Pages.
        Yes, it's pronounced Oghliner, like trough, Gough Street, and ghoti!
        It provides a template for an offline web app, so you can bootstrap a new app.
        It also provides tools to offline and deploy an existing app on GitHub Pages.
        Those tools can be used via a command line or integrated into a build system like Gulp and Grunt.
        Finally, it automates the process of configuring Travis CI to auto-deploy to GitHub Pages.

      Is ServiceWorker ready? is a more up-to-date website specifically for Service Workers.
      Regardless, it's early days. But Service Workers is a progressive enhancement.
      You can add it to your website now, and it gracefully degrades to your existing experience
      in browsers that don't support Service Workers, while becoming offline on browsers
      that do support them.

        The spec says:
        <blockquote><p>
          Service workers should be implemented to be HTTPS-only. The reasons for SSL-only support include:
          <ul>
            <li>Better to protect end users from man-in-the-middle attacks</li>
            <li>Do good by encouraging HTTPS adoption</li>
            <li>Existing "playground" services (e.g. github.io) now work with HTTPS</li>
            <li>HTTPS is coming across much more of the web quickly</li>
            <li>Devtools can loosen the restriction for development (file://, localhost, etc.)</li>
